Monad, Functional Programming features for Rust

# Why

I love functional programing, Rx-style coding.

However it's hard to implement them in Rust, and there're few libraries to achieve parts of them.

Thus I implemented fpRust. I hope you would like it :)

# Features

* Optional/Maybe (Just a wrapper to built-in Option<T>, to make it more like a monad Maybe)

* Monad, Rx-like

~~* Publisher~~



~~* Pattern matching~~

~~* Fp functions~~



~~* Java8Stream-like Collection~~

~~* PythonicGenerator-like Coroutine(yield/yieldFrom)~~


# Usage
